# a repository that has uncommitted changes.

# Parameters:
# $1 : Path to the lbuild-based directory (my-repo/my-project-repo)
# $2 : Path to the external taproot folder (my-repo/taproot)
# $3 : (Optional) Space-delimited string containing acceptable remote taproot branches
#       to base this project on. Default value is "release".
